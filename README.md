So this is pretty much me just messing around with python

Overtime I hope to add more and more app to this but so far this is what I have:
- Instagram Account searcher
  - They way it works is by scraping the web for your data by passing your username through the link, really, really simple.
- Instagram user collector
  - what this does is searches a tag and then scrapes the webpage for usernames and adds it to the collection
#Todo's
- Feed the list of the usernames that are collected to the account searcher
- take data from the account searcher and admit them to the database
  - not sure how i'm going to do this
- make a database
- make a scheduler for the database
- create restful api to use the data
- setup vm in google or azure (which ever will be the cheapest tbh)
